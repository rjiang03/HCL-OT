This code is a modified version of the official HCL implementation by [Josh/HCL](https://github.com/joshr17/HCL). The only difference from the original code is a minor alteration in the hard negative sampling approach. To ensure a fair comparison, we have maintained all hyperparameters in Josh's implementation as they were in the original code.

Part of this code is inspired by [leftthomas/SimCLR](https://github.com/leftthomas/SimCLR), by [Josh/HCL](https://github.com/joshr17/HCL), and by [fanyun-sun/InfoGraph](https://github.com/fanyun-sun/InfoGraph).
