This code is a modification of the official InfoGraph code by [Josh/HCL](https://github.com/joshr17/HCL). All code is the same as from their code except the simple modification on the way do hard negative sampling. We keep all hyper-parameter the same as the one in Josh's code.

Part of this code is inspired by [leftthomas/SimCLR](https://github.com/leftthomas/SimCLR), by [Josh/HCL](https://github.com/joshr17/HCL), and by [fanyun-sun/InfoGraph](https://github.com/fanyun-sun/InfoGraph).
